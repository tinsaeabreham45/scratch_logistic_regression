# Logistic Regression from Scratch

A Python-based implementation of logistic regression from scratch, designed to enhance understanding of machine learning fundamentals without relying on libraries like `scikit-learn`.

## Features

- **Sigmoid Function**: Implements the activation function used in logistic regression.
- **Parameter Initialization**: Sets up initial weights and biases for the model.
- **Forward and Backward Propagation**: Computes predictions and gradients for optimization.
- **Optimization**: Adjusts weights and biases using gradient descent.
- **Prediction**: Uses the trained model to make predictions on new data.
- **Visualization**: Plots the learning curve to visualize training progress.
